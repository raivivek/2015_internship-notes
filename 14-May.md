Pradeep had already prepared the pre-inoculum using which we inoculated the
bigger flasks containing 200 ml, 200 ml and 400 ml of terrific media.

The cells were obtained from the Glycerol stocks of BL21(DE3) cells transformed
with vectors containing the gene of interest that expresses the ClyA protein;
the core of our study.

For inoculation, 1 % pre-inoculum is sufficient and thus we add 2 ml, 2 ml and
4 ml of the cultured cells to these flasks respectively.

The flasks are then kept in shaker, incubator at 37 degrees Celsius for 4
hours. Since, this media is very rich, it allows for very fast growth of
bacteria allowing the OD of the media to reach as high as 1.5 in around  4
hours. It is during this time that we'll induce the protein expression using
IPTG and culture them overnight.

Pradeep also briefed me a bit about the work we'll be doing next. He is due to
receive DNA samples encoding ClyA protein which can easily fluorescently
labeled and used in experiments to monitor it's activity and assembly process.

Theory
------

[o] Read about different bacterial recombination protein expression systems,
    for example BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLys, BL21(DE3) Star etc.,
    The features of their chromosomes, vectors used, growth conditions etc.,

[o] Read about homologous recombination and its different pathways,
    conformational proofreading(\*)

Other
-----

Added a few templates to Metakgp project.
