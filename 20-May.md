Affinity Chromatography
=======================

Pradeep was not available today so no experiments could be performed. Most of
my day was studying in a self guided manner the use of different lab reagents
and principles of different experiments that we have performed till now (for
example, Affinity chromatography).

Besides, an appreciable time was also spent meeting people around the lab
and getting to know what they are working on.
