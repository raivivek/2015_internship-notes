Today was our welcome address and with that the official commencement of the
internship program. Bio Engineering Summer Training program, also known as BEST
is an inter-disciplinary program started by Indian Institute of Science from
this session to provide students opportunity to see and do a bit of research.

I have other 9 co interns in the same program, all of which are selected into
different projects and labs according to their preference given during the
initial selection. The program is currently coordinated by Dr. Rahul Roy, who
also happens to be an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur.

After initial introductions, we were given a small token of gift containing
necessary stationary that we might need. Followed by a brief snacks period
where I had a moment to talk with my mentor Prof. Sandhya S. V., Prof. Rahul Roy,
Prof. Murthy and other co interns. They are all very friendly and pleasant
people to work with. Soon we were introduced to the guys from the first
bioengineering batch who will be there as our formal and informal contact for
all sorts of stuff.

We all then left for our labs to proceed with the projects.

Lab
---

[ ] Transform the plasmid DNA of single and double mutated ClyA proteins into
    BL21(DE3) strains.
[ ] Express and purify proteins.
[ ] Perform further assays and experiments as may be necessary.

Above is a proposed plan for our activities in the coming few days. For the
first step, I prepared the media, autoclaved materials, prepared the agar
plates and stored them as necessary in the cold room for further use.

These Amp+ agar plates will be use to transform the bacteria and pick up
colonies which again will be used for expressing proteins in larger quantities
later.

This took entire day.

Theory
------

[o] Mueller et. al. The structure of a cytolytic alpha-helical toxin pore
    reveals its assembly mechanism.

Others
------

I met Sintu today. He's also working with the SSV lab as a post-doc and has
done his PhD from IIT Kharagpur under Prof. S. K. Ghosh.

Added few more templates to Metakgp.
