Technical Writing Session
=========================

The most important event today was unarguably the technical writing session in
the evening from 3.30pm to 5.30pm. While, the title of the talk mentioned about
technical writing, the presenter chose to touch on simpler topics which focus
mainly on the aspects of clear and comprehensible writing. The handout distributed
at the end read - 'Principles of writing with clarity'.

The presenter (// find name) touched upon a couple of principles, mostly
related to clause, sentence and paragraph construction that could improve
the readability and comprehensibility of writing. He beautifully illustrated
the principles with the help of examples and kept the session interactive
throughout by discussing with audience. The level of presentation was more
appropriate from beginners but even experienced could have had some bits to
learn.

Overall, it was a good session and worth the time. Thanks to BEST program and
