DPPC:Cholesterol - II
=====================

The most important events today were -

1. Had a brief chat with Prof. Sandhya and discussed about the work that I can
   do in the remaining time period of two weeks. She suggested that I should
probably go ahead with vesicle preparation using the lipids extracted from the
RBC membrane. Once this is done, I should immediately begin writing my report
from correction and submission.

However, I have only around 100 ul of ClyA 56C protein left. It means that if I
go with the RBC lipid experiments then requirement of more protein will necessitate another
protein purification.

Keeping this (the worst case scenario!) in mind, I already transformed the
BL21-endo(-) competent cell stock with ClyA56C plasmid and keep the plates in
incubator. Tomorrow, I'll prepare the media and induce so as to keep a ready stock
of cells which we can quickly use for protein extraction.

2. Rode on bicycle to Chemical Engineering department and inoculated the lipid
   bilayer film with Calcein and buffer. After freeze-thaw cycles and vortex, I
left the vial at 4 degree C for overnight incubation. Tomorrow, I'll sonicate and
elute the vesicles through the column.
