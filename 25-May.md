Transformation #2
=================

*25th May 2015, 10.00pm*

With second Monday into the program, began the weekly lectures on specialized
topics to be given by the eminent faculties of the institute itself. Classes
are usually scheduled from 10.00 am to 11.00 am in the morning and span from
around four days a week from Monday to Thursday.

Today's class began on introduction to biomaterials and tissue engineering
as taught by Prof. Kaushik Chatterjee.

Also, to begin with the purification of mutant proteins, we needed to transform
the plasmids into the expression strains so that they can later be grown into
larger solutions for more protein.
