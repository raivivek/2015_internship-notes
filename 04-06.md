Wild type protein prep
======================

*04th May 2015, 11.00pm*

Today we wanted to extract and purify the ClyA wild type protein from the cell
cultures grown overnight.

The procedure followed was exactly same as in the previous time, but the
majority of work was handled by me this time except concentrating the protein
using the concentrator vials.

(*Detailed protocol in lab notebook*)

The peak observed in FPLC graph was quite high (3x the mutant protein)
indicating a very high yield of protein. This also supported the precipitate we
were getting when trying to wash and elute the bound protein.

I'd want to run a SDS PAGE tomorrow and verify the presence of protein and get
a rough indication of the amount of protein obtained.
