Report your work
================

Today's morning marked the beginning of my last week of internship at Indian
Institute of Science. With report deadline coming up this Friday, there
remained a little scope for me to be able to do any experiment and document my
findings as well. Hence, after a discussion with Prof. Sandhya, I decided the
Calcein leakage assay with RBC lipids is not probably not worth for the time
being.

Besides, this week will also be the final for internship of three other people
in the lab. They are ought to present their work tomorrow during the lab
meeting, along with the usual work and paper presentation.

The final week will also conclude with the set of four lectures on Systems
Biology by Prof. Narendra Dixit; the first one of which was delivered today.
It was a good introduction to the subject using a classic study of bacterial
motility i.e., how the bacteria employs a system of enzymes and network that
acts as an integral controller.

I'm also trying to add content to my report (albeit slowly!). Hopefully it will
be done a day or before the final deadline of submission (10th of July) so that
I can send it for review to others as well.
