Protein activity assay
======================

*30th May 2015, 10.00pm*

After a rough indication of good protein yield, we had to quantify it exactly using
usual Bradford assay and also do an activity assay by RBC lysis.

The Bradford assay (after a couple of tries with volume of protein to be taken so that
it falls within the measurement range) provided a yield of 600 ng/ul protein, which is
almost 4 folds the amount of protein yield obtained earlier by Pradeep for the wild
type protein.

In the RBC lysis experiment, however, we didn't observe that amount of activity
initially even with the high concentrations of protein. It then came to mind that
perhaps because of one extra cystein mutations, protein is forming intra/inter
molecular disulfide bridges thereby restricting the activity. To test this
idea, we further added Beta mercaptoethanol to the lysis solution and obtained
a strong increase in activity (and a good support to the Bradford data we
obtained). However, to ensure that the Beta mercaptoethanol itself was not
causing the lysis of cell, we add it to the blank as well and could obtain no
increase in optical density values there.

This confirmed the idea that a higher conc. of beta mercaptoethanol is needed
for this protein to work, this in addition to already four fold increase that
we did in the lysis buffer compared to what is needed for wild type protein (20
mM vs 5 mM).
