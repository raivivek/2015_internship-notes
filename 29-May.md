SDS-PAGE, Protein estimation
============================

*29th May 2015, 08.50pm*

Today we had to run the SDS PAGE of the protein eluates that we obtained from
the gel filtration (size-exclusion) chromatography column. We had obtained three
peaks corresponding to fraction 3-4, fraction 10-11 and fraction 13-16.

These samples were run on gel along with the load and 30 K pellet to obtain
an estimate of other protein contaminants and a rough indication of the
quantity of protein that we have obtained.

The gel run was completed easily and we could see distinct protein band
corresponding to expected size of the protein. There were faint bands
indicating some contaminant which we weren't expecting. The intensity of
commassie blue indicated a good yield of the protein when compared to the
previous attempts by Pradeep.

Good going so far.

Also, in the end we had a talk by associate professor Dr. Bikramjit Basu on
"External field mediated cellular functionality modulation on engineered
substrates." He works with the materials research center and has been actively
working in the field of tissue engineering since a decade. The talk was
informative, but I found it more like a paper presentation than an interactive
session that I was expecting it to be. A lot of slides with description of
some experiment and the effects obtained. Since real molecular explanation
or insight into the cause of such effects were described, I felt a bit
unsatisfied towards the end.
