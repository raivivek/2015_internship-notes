Locating IISc and my laboratory
===============================
*Mon 11 May, 10.00 pm*

Today was my first day at [Indian Institute of
Science](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/), within the [Molecular Reproduction and
Development Genetics](http://www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/) department of [Biological
Sciences division](www.be.iisc.ernet.in). I'll be working there as student
researcher for the next two months along with [Pradeep S.]() and under the
supervision of [Prof. Sandhya S.
Visweswariah](http://www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/sandhyav/index.htm).

IISc has a beautiful campus. Calm and quiet roads, scattered with bright
flowers falling from trees, and the whole atmosphere filled with chirping of
birds, often broken by low murmur of passing groups discussing their work
or leisure.

Since Prof. Sandhya was out of town, Pradeep briefed me about his work and
the work that he has done till now. He also introduced me to all the present
lab members and showed me way around the laboratory and to the canteen.

Work
----

Pradeep is working on the characterization of pore forming toxin (PFT) *ClyA*
which is obtained from *E.Coli*. It's a soluble, 30 kDa protein which assembles
into a dodecameric pore complex in the presence of membranes or detergent. It
is one of the best such examples because the transition of molecule from
monomer to pore forming protomer units involves rearrangement of more than half
of the total residues.

The current work that he's finishing up onto involves the study of a C terminal
helix that, although doesn't show significant rearrangement during monomer to
protomer stage, disrupts or even stops the activity of toxin complex when
removed/deleted from the structure. This was verified by measuring the activity
and other properties of deletion mutant versus normal protein complex. Several
experiments were designed to study the role of this portion along the different
stages in the pore formation and its role was characterized.

Other
-----

I learned that Tushar is also working as a summer student researcher in the
Biochemistry department which is located in the first floor. We met and had a
nice coffee.
