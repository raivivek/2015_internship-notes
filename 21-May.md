Transformation
==============

*21st May 2015, 10.00 pm*

We have received the two plasmids from Zurich containing the 56C and 252C, 56C
mutations. These will facilitate us to perform a number of activity assays using
fluorescence labeling later.

To begin with those studies, we had to transform these plasmid into appropriate
cloning competent cells for generating more plasmid, which will later be
subjected to verification and transformation into the protein expression
strain.

We also discussed the RBC membrane extraction work that will be done later.
