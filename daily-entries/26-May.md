Mutant Proteins
===============

*26th May 2015, 11.00pm*

The colonies from the plates plated yesterday were harvested today and put into
the 200 ml terrific broth media prepared. This upon proper growth and
incubation with IPTC will give us sufficient amount of protein to work with
after an overnight culture. The growth of the cells was monitored using optical
density measurements.

Also, today was the second lecture of Tissue Engineering series by Kaushik
Chatterjee.

Besides this, a significant part of the was spent in weekly lab meeting. This
was my second meeting and today Anisha presented her work while Natasha
presented a paper.

At last, cleaned the gel rockers as a part of my lab responsibilities.
