First failure
=============

*17 May 2015, 9.07 pm*

I think I faced my first failure today. Well, first of all, one shouldn't
really expect a lot from that statement since I wasn't really doing something
groundbreaking, the failure of which shattered months (even years!) of my
research efforts. Infact, what happened is that for the first time today,
things didn't happen as they were expected to, despite being cautious enough
along all the way. Till now, as one may have noticed, I had carried out all
experiments with good results and everything seemed to go on fine. Today, however,
despite beginning on a high note with the awesome lecture 3 of neural engineering,
ended up in an experiment with poor outcomes.

I'm talking about the Calcein release assay of the ClyAWT and ClyA56C that we
were to do today. After eluding vesicles from the lipid solution and preparing
appropriate solutions to test the lysis, we couldn't observe:
- any appreciable activity to begin with. The difference between the two
  proteins causing leakage and the dye out in the solution wasn't great and
  convincing at all.
- the leakage measurement (wrt fluorescence) was decreasing over the time
  (weird?) instead of increasing. Note that, It's not that I want it to
  increase but infact it has been repeatedly done and verified in the lab itself
  quite before by Pradeep.

Since we know that our proteins are active, the only thing that we can doubt in
this experiment is the preparation of our lipid vesicles and that's the first
thing that we are going to try again - from scratch, tomorrow. This truly revealed
to me (after that RBC Lysis trials) that research indeed requires patience and
sometimes you might not be able to reproduce something that you have done
tens of times before. It becomes careful to analyze all your steps and carefully
backtrack to the position which might have caused this fault.

For example, in this example of lipid vesicle preparation, there were two things
that (according to Pradeep), we did differently:
- we didn't leave the vial after calcein addition for an overnight incubation.
- we had to add buffer after the sonication but by mistake we added it before. This
  must have diluted the concentration inside many vesicles.

We honestly have no idea why and by how much these factors can influence the
result or if they did anything at all. But assuming this to be the culprits for
the time being, we'll attempt another lipid vesicle preparation - appropriately
taking these into account.

Apart from that, not to mention the great lecture on neural engineering by
Aditya Murthy to start the day with. Today he outlined principle components and
examples related to response selection and response execution, with most part
consisting of the latter topic. He also talked (he does so very nicely!) about
motor control, it's complexity, value system of brain etc., all that we can
only fathom in our minds. Amazing.

We also had a demonstration for the Dynamic Light Scattering instrument today.
It seems to work well, we also gave it a shot with our prepared lipid vesicles.
The result analyzer reported a mean intensity peak of approx 100 nm, with
indications of a good quality data.
