DPPC:Cholesterol - IV, Arka's birthday
======================================

I repeated the calcein release experiment today with ClyA WT and ClyA 56C,
incubated in equivalent amounts (5 ug) with DPPC:Cholesterol vesicles. A
kinetic cycle of around one hour revealed a similar pattern of activity for
both the proteins with faster kinetics - similar to what we observed in the
case of DOPC:Cholesterol vesicles (at least for ClyA WT).

From our experiments, we can observe the distinct kinetic behavior of ClyA WT
in two phase lipid bilayer vesicles (DOPC:Cholesterol or DPPC:Cholesterol) and
three phase lipid bilayer vesicles (DPPC:DOPC:Cholesterol). This could a useful
information for further studies which are based on preparation and activity
assays on lipid bilayers for ClyA and similar pore forming toxins. Hopefully,
it is going to be a significant part of my report.

Other than this, we BEST fellows received the due notification for our project
report and presentation submission along with the guidelines. It's going to be
challenging for us indeed, with presentation in front of a large audience and
questioning eyes.

It's going to take a good deal of effort to complete these things and hence I
think that's all the experiment work that I could do during my 8 week
internship.

Also, today we wished Arka for his birthday. He is a post doctoral researcher
in the lab and recently published his paper in JBC. Many congratulations to
him.
