First Seminar
=============

*22nd May 2015, 10.00 pm*

The transformed cells that we plated on agar plates had come up in tiny
colonies (around 40-50). These were to be picked into 3 ml liquid cultures
for growth and multiplication, which later will provide sufficient quantity
for extraction of plasmid DNA.

Besides lab, there was an amazing seminar/talk by [Prof.
Suresh](http://www.mecheng.iisc.ernet.in/~suresh/) (he's a mechanical engineer)
on protein design optimization. His work presently an entirely new approach of
designing protein sequences in a reverse way (i.e., geometry to sequence) using
mathematical optimization theory.

Also, I had a brief discussion with Prof. Sandhya where we discussed about protein
sequencing and identification methods, specially MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Lab
---

Pick up colonies from agar plates and transfer to 3 ml media for over night
(approx 15-16 hours) of growth.

Theory
------

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, peptide fingerprinting, tandem mass spectrometry
