Lab Meeting
===========

*19 May 2015, 10.00 pm*

Today was the more gratifying day since I joined the lab. In the sense that I
felt the work pressure, witnessed a grilling lab meeting session, and advanced
to almost 150 pages in a book that I started just a day before.

I had a brief chat with my professor today where she inquired about my progress
during the past week. I presented in detail the papers I have gone through, the
experiments I have followed and faced a couple of questions on the related
principles. I was happy to learn that she pays a great attention to details and
encouraged me to do the same. Not just read between the lines but study and
reason about things with a scientific point of view.

I am expected to be prepared with a complete and rigorous understanding of the
work I am involved, which in a sense bestowed a sense of responsibility on me.


Pradeep was to present his work in the lab meeting today, and he did so
promptly. There were interesting questions raised during the meeting with
due attention from the professor and other lab mates. There were a number
of places where experiments can be done with improved samples and few other
data required altogether new experiments to be done. The work presentation
was followed by a paper presentation bu Abinaya. The notes for both of these
sessions are duly recorded in the notebook.

No lab work performed today. However, Pradeep is trying to purify the protein
that he purified (from the cell culture done last week) since he observed a
contaminant protein in SDS-PAGE experiment. This would require him to cleave
the (His)6 tag with TEV protease (Tobacco etch virus) and again passing on a
Ni-Agarose bead which will remove the contaminant, leaving us the pure protein.
