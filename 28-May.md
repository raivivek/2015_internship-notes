Protein Purification
====================

A toast to the first successful protein purification of my life - starting from
the scratch with the plasmid vectors to the purification of a 'significant'
amount of protein is a big deal, it took a total of 4 days.

Today was also the final lecture of the series on tissue engineering and Prof.
Rahul Roy also happened to be there to thank everyone.

After the lecture was over, I came to the lab quickly and we began the protein
preparation. It involved a lot of time consuming and manual steps like lysing
the cells, centrifuging, equilibrating the column, measuring OD values, washing
and elution of beads and finally the gel filtration.

In gel filtration, we obtained three peaks and the target protein was obtained
in the fractions corresponding to 13-16. The peak was considerably higher compared
to previous purification attempts, as told by Pradeep. So we are expecting a good
yield of pure protein this time.
