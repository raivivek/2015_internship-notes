Three work presentations
========================

The most important highlights of today were:

1. Second lecture in the systems biology series by Prof. Narendra. He took a
   more complicated example of MAPK signaling pathway today and illustrated
some of the important features of a complex system (a system where it is
difficult to assess the property based on the presence of individual components
on alone). The important conclusions of today's talk were:

   * A complicated network or system can be often be broken down into smaller
     subgroups, motifs or modules which are responsible for imparting one or
more characteristics to the system.
   * It is possible to analyze a network at different levels of complication.
     We can group some of the elements into a black box and be concerned only
with their input and output relations or model each and every reaction with
proper details. Each action will provide different level of insight into the
system.
   * Since biological networks do not exist in isolation (as is often studied
     in systems biology), a correct quantitative prediction is difficult to
draw from it. It is important to keep this in mind and use these modeling
approaches for a qualitative understanding.

2. Work presentation by Anindita, Harsha and Divya. All of them discussed their
   work done during the respective internship period within the lab.

Towards the end, I prepared the gel images and properly annotated them for
putting into my presentation. I had to revisit my graphs and probably will
need to replot them before I put them into my report. Deadline is coming up
fast.
