DOPC, DPPC
==========

Pushed forward by yesterday's outcome, we set to prepare the next set of lipid
vesicles once again from scratch. This time, however, Pradeep mentioned that
some of the proteins have better binding towards membrane patches or lipid
domains which are more like a gel phase dispersed in liquid phase. A number of
receptor proteins are known to bind the membrane in this way.[1]

So, as an experiment, we thought of preparing a DOPC:DPPC:Cholesterol mixture
as well, with absolutely no idea that how it will work out.

Most part of the day was spent in preparation of these vesicles, according the
same protocol as before.

In the evening, there was a talk on "Decoding Human Genomes on a Population
Scale" by Dr. Shankar Balasubramanian. It was a greatly anticipated talk, I
wasn't surprised to see a full house when I reached there 5 minutes there.
Sadly, I had to leave after 30 minutes after my legs gave up.
