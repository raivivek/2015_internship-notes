Disaster
========

What was planned:

[x] Dialysis of protein for removal of all reducing agents and undesired ions
    from the buffer.
[x] Fluorescence labeling reaction to label the protein.
[x] Run micro spin column and remove the unreacted dye.

What actually happened:

[ ] Protein lost due to a breakage in the dialysis membrane.
[ ] No dye obtained due to unavailability of concerned people.
[ ] Micro spin column lost as water crept into the setup and washed the beads away.

Although, besides everything going wrong, today also began the lecture series
on Biomechanics. It was a good introduction and the work that the PhD student
described is really interesting. They are doing a really cool work trying to
understand the 'boring' mechanism and mechanical systems employed by insects.

Towards the end, I met with the professor and discussed my work done last week.
However, my data wasn't plotted properly, causing confusion and leading to
haphazard explanation. I'd have to prepare and annotate them properly and also
update my lab notebook.
