DPPC:Cholesterol
================

Today, Pradeep advised me to finish the Calcein release assay with the freshly
prepared DPPC:Cholesterol vesicles. In my earlier experiments, I worked with
two types of vesicles - DPPC:DOPC:Cholesterol and DOPC:Cholesterol. There were,
however, surprising results which we couldn't establish as to what exactly
might have happened.

One idea that arose out of the discussion was that what we saw is possibly one
of the characteristic differences between a three phase (DPPC mixture) and two
phase (DOPC mixture) systems, which behave quite differently (cite). This is what
led us to perform this experiment and see if the DPPC:Cholesterol vesicles are
behaving any differently than the DOPC:Cholesterol vesicles, except in commonly
known properties.

We went to chemical engineering department in the evening, and I prepared a 20
mM (1:1, DPPC:Cholesterol) mixture and left for dessication. Next day, I'll put
calcein and prepare the vesicles.

Apart from this, the ongoing talks on Biomechanics concluded today with a rather
mathematical intensive description of modeling cell-tissue interactions. It was
an informative talk and provided much insights into the investigations being
carried out in this field and related complexity or rigor required for pursuing
it. There are a lot of open questions that need to answered but we can only do
our best.
