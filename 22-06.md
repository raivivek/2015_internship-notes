Tagging Protein
===============

Today was a hectic day with a talk and the lab meeting scheduled back to back.
The pre-lunch time was spent in reading a paper, organizing my data while the
latter part was spent in equilibration and preparing the micro spin column.

The lecture today was taken by Prof. Namrata Gundiah and was essentially a
quick introduction to her work and other related fields. It was an interesting
topic with details on insects fly, the 'boring' organism, modeling the flight
mechanism as a manual transmission system of car and a few techniques like
Micro-CT and Atomic Force Microscopy.

The lab meeting consisted of work presentation by Abinaya and paper
presentation by Arka.

Towards the end, Pradeep finally obtained the dye with which we are going to
label the protein, and he'll carry out the reaction and separation part. We had
already setup the dialysis this time before, along with a stronger dialysis
membrane on the top of the usual dialysis membrane.
