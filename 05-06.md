Acrylamide solution
===================

*05th May 2015, 10.00pm*

After the wild type protein purification completed yesterday, today I wanted
to run a SDS-PAGE and verify the presence of protein (at the same time, get a
rough indication of quantity obtained).

Later, however, there was a bioengineering seminar on the *The motor protein -
Dynein* by [Dr. Vaishnavi Ananthanarayan](http://www.be.iisc.ernet.in/~vaish/)
who heads the [Cytoskeleton and Motors
Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/cytomotorslab/) as a part of the
bioengineering program of Indian Institute of Science.

The talk was quite detailed and gave a brief account of the work she has done
for her PhD and post doctoral work and also the ongoing work being done by the
interns in her lab.

After seminar when I went to run gel, I found that acrylamide stock solution
was over and had to be prepared freshly. Arka agreed to mentor me for this
daunting task and it took around one hour to finally prepare the stock.

I will run the gel on Monday.
