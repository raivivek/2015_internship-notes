Confocal Microscopy
===================

*27th May 2015, 10.00pm*

The bacterial cell culture left for overnight growth at 16 degrees was
retrieved in the morning, and cell pellets were obtained by centrifuging the
total 200 ml volume per culture in two bottles for 10-15 min at 4 degrees.

The lysis buffer was prepared and added to the cell pellets, homogenized and
stored in the sonication vials at -80 degrees.

The protein preparation will be done tomorrow.

Also, I met Prof. Sandhya today and briefed her about the updates within the
past few days. We had a nice cordial discussion about how I should be planning
the next steps once I have a purified protein and how should I go thinking
about it.

I also spent 2-3 hours along with Deepthi and Pradeep today in the Physics
department doing confocal microscopy. It is really a magnificent piece of
instrument.
