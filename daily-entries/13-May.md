Media, is all I need.

Lab

We decided to collect some fresh protein samples of ClyA protein for our
further study. This requires us to go through a number of processes starting
with the growth and culture of the bacteria to their lysis, extraction of
protein and purification.

Pradeep showed me the way around the lab, where can I find different
apparatuses for the experiments, related media powders, chemicals, and
autoclave room etc., The first, obviously, is to decide the amount of media to
be prepared and collect the necessary flasks and test tubes for it. Since
proteins are generally not obtained at very high yields, a large amount of
culture has to be established.

For this, I prepared 800 ml terrific broth liquid media and distributed in
three flasks having 200 ml, 200 ml and 400 ml each. I also prepared 30 ml of LB
broth liquid media for preparing the pre-inoculum and distributed in 5 test
tubes each containing 5 ml (rest was discarded). Plugged properly and wrapped
with paper, glassware along with pipette tips were properly autoclaved.

After autoclaving for ~20 minutes, we closed the power to heater and let the
apparatus cool down for next 15 minutes. The items were then removed from the
chamber and safely brought back to the lab.


Theory
------


[o] Read up about recombination protein expression systems, the factors
    that can influence the yield and how or why it is controlled.

[o] Fusion tag, Leaky expression, pET vectors, protein expression induction,
    terrific broth etc.,
